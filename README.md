# Real-Time Financial Fraud Detection & Monitoring System

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Real-Time Financial Fraud Detection & Monitoring System** is an enterprise-grade streaming analytics platform designed to **detect, score, and monitor suspicious financial transactions in real time** using modern data engineering and machine learning practices.

The system leverages **Databricks Structured Streaming**, **Delta Lake Medallion Architecture (Bronze–Silver–Gold)**, and **ML-based anomaly detection** to deliver **low-latency fraud insights** and **interactive dashboards** for operational and strategic decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

Financial institutions process millions of transactions per day and must:

* Detect fraud in real time
* Minimize financial losses
* Reduce false positives
* Maintain transparency and auditability

Traditional batch-only systems fail to respond quickly to evolving fraud patterns.

### ✅ Our Solution

A **fully streaming, ML-powered fraud detection system** that:

* Ingests live transaction data
* Scores transactions using anomaly detection
* Surfaces fraud trends and alerts in real time
* Enables rapid investigation and response

## 🤖 Machine Learning Strategy

### Model Used

**Isolation Forest (Anomaly Detection)**

### Why?

* Fraud is rare and evolving
* Labels may be delayed or unavailable
* Model adapts to changing behavior

### Training Approach

* **Batch training** on Silver data
* **Streaming inference** on live transactions
* **MLflow** for tracking and versioning

---

The system provides:

* Real-time fraud trends
* Fraud rate monitoring
* High-risk entity identification
* Live fraud alerts
* Fraud impact analysis

These dashboards enable:

* Operational monitoring
* Investigation prioritization
* Executive reporting

---

## 🔐 Reliability & Governance

* Schema enforcement
* Exactly-once processing
* Checkpoint-based fault tolerance
* Reproducible ML pipelines
* Audit-ready Gold datasets
